# Simple Blackjack Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Blackjack card game. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21. Players are dealt two cards initially and have the option to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (end their turn). The dealer must follow specific rules for drawing additional cards. The game ends when the player decides to stand, reaches a total of 21, or busts (exceeds 21).

## How to Play
- Run the game by executing the main script.
- The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt one card face up and one card face down.
- The player decides whether to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
- If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
- After the player's turn, the dealer reveals their face-down card and draws additional cards according to specific rules.
- The game ends when the player decides to stand, reaches a total of 21, or busts.
